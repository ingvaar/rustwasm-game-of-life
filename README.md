Rust Wasm Game of Life
======================

> A simple Rust Wasm project to experiment with this technology

## :pencil: Description

This project aims to explore the [Rust WebAssembly tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html) and experiment with it.

My goals here are:

- Understand the Rust WebAssembly principles.
- Try to improve the project with some tools I use the most (Docker, Yarn,...).
- Explore a new way to use the Rust language.

> :warning: This project is in early developement phase.
